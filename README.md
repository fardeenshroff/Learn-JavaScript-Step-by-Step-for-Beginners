## 2. Setting Up Your Environment

### 2.1 Download Node.js (for running JavaScript on your system):
Go to [nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download) and download the latest version for your operating system.

### 2.2 Install a Text Editor or IDE:
Recommended IDEs:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

### 2.3 Verify Installation:
Open your terminal/command prompt and type:
```bash
node --version

This will display the installed version of Node.js.

### 3. JavaScript Basics

3.1 Variables and Data Types:

Declare variables using var, let, or const.

let name = "Alice";
const age = 30;
let isActive = true;

Data types: String, Number, Boolean, Object, Array, Null, Undefined.

3.2 Input and Output:

Use console.log() for output and prompt() for input:

let name = prompt("Enter your name: ");
console.log("Hello, " + name);

3.3 Basic Syntax:

JavaScript uses semicolons to terminate statements:

let age = 25;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
}

3.4 Operators:

Arithmetic (+, -, *, /), comparison (==, !=, <, >), logical (&&, ||, !).

4. Control Flow

4.1 Conditional Statements:

Use if, else if, and else for decision-making:

if (age < 18) {
    console.log("Minor");
} else if (age === 18) {
    console.log("Just turned adult!");
} else {
    console.log("Adult");
}

4.2 Loops:

for loop for iteration:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

while loop for repeated execution:

let count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    console.log(count);
    count++;
}

4.3 Break and Continue:

break to exit the loop and continue to skip an iteration:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 3) {
        break;  // Exits the loop when i equals 3
    }
    console.log(i);
}

5. Functions

5.1 Defining Functions:

Use the function keyword to define a function:

function greet(name) {
    return Hello, ${name};
}

5.2 Arguments and Return Values:

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add(3, 5));  // Output: 8

5.3 Arrow Functions:

A more concise way to write functions:

const greet = (name) => Hello, ${name};
console.log(greet("Alice"));

6. Data Structures

6.1 Arrays:

Arrays are ordered collections:

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

6.2 Objects:

Objects are key-value pairs:

let student = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 22
};

6.3 Sets:

A collection of unique values:

let uniqueNumbers = new Set([1, 2, 3, 3, 4]);

6.4 Maps:

A collection of key-value pairs, similar to objects, but with better performance for frequent additions/removals:

let map = new Map();
map.set("name", "Alice");

7. Object-Oriented Programming

7.1 Classes and Objects:

Create classes using the class keyword:

class Car {
    constructor(brand, model) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
    }
    drive() {
        console.log(${this.brand} ${this.model} is driving.);
    }
}
const myCar = new Car("Tesla", "Model S");
myCar.drive();

8. DOM Manipulation

8.1 Selecting Elements:

Use document.querySelector() or document.getElementById() to select DOM elements:

let element = document.querySelector("#myElement");
element.style.color = "blue";

8.2 Modifying Elements:

Change content with innerHTML:

document.getElementById("myElement").innerHTML = "New content!";

8.3 Event Listeners:

Attach events to elements:

document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
});

9. Error and Exception Handling

9.1 Try-Catch Block:

Handle errors gracefully:

try {
    let result = 10 / 0;
} catch (error) {
    console.log("Error: " + error);
}

9.2 Throwing Errors:

Throw custom errors:

throw new Error("Something went wrong!");

10. Modules and Libraries

10.1 Using Built-in Modules:

Node.js comes with built-in modules like fs, path, etc.:

const fs = require("fs");
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});

10.2 Installing External Libraries:

Use npm (Node Package Manager) to install third-party libraries:

npm install lodash
